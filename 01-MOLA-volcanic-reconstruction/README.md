# Noctis Mons, Mars — Pre-Volcanic Surface Reconstruction & Volume Estimation

Analysis of Noctis Mons, a recently confirmed Martian shield volcano, using MOLA spherical harmonic topography data and QGIS-sampled elevation shapefiles. The project reconstructs the pre-volcanic surface beneath the construct, estimates the volume of the uplifted terrain, and compares the result against other Martian shield volcanoes.

## Notebooks

### 1. `Point_Distribution_Interpolation_QGIS.ipynb`
**Surface sampling, interpolation, and thickness grid**

Loads two sets of QGIS-sampled elevation points — one for the base (exposed, low-lying) surface and one for the raised (high) surface — and uses Radial Basis Function (RBF) interpolation to reconstruct both as continuous grids. The MOLA spherical harmonic model is expanded into a regional DEM centred on Noctis Mons. A thickness grid is computed by subtracting the interpolated base surface from the present-day MOLA topography, representing the height of existing raised features above the underlying plain.

Key steps:
- MOLA SH model loading and DH grid expansion (`pyshtools`)
- Regional DEM extraction for the Noctis Mons study area
- RBF interpolation of base and raised QGIS sample points
- Thickness grid computation and 2-D / 3-D visualisation

### 2. `Reconstruction_Volcanic_Surface.ipynb`
**Pre-volcanic surface reconstruction, profile analysis, and volume estimation**

Extends the analysis to a wider ~2000 km regional context. Multi-azimuth elevation profiles are extracted from the Noctis centre to identify the lateral extent of volcanic uplift, cross-referenced against overlaid extensional and compressional tectonic fault maps. A circular mask is applied over the construct and the underlying terrain is reconstructed via RBF interpolation on a low-resolution MOLA grid, yielding a pre-volcanic reference surface. The reconstructed raised surface is then inserted back into the regional map. Volume is estimated by integrating the uplift grid over spherical grid-cell areas.

Key steps:
- 2000 km regional DEM extraction (high- and low-resolution MOLA grids)
- Multi-azimuth radial elevation profiling with interactive uplift bound selection
- Spline-based gap filling and profile detrending
- Circular masking and RBF reconstruction of the pre-Noctis surface
- Uplift grid computation and volume integration
- Comparison of elevation profiles with Tharsis Tholus and Hecates Tholus

## Data Sources

| Dataset | Source |
|---|---|
| MOLA topography | Fetched programmatically via `pyshtools.datasets.Mars.MOLA_shape()` — no manual download required |
| Tectonic fault traces | `extedatafaults.geojson`, `compdatafaults.geojson` — included in this repository |
| Elevation sample points | QGIS-sampled shapefiles (`base elevations_2.shp`, `raised elevations_2.shp`) — paths must be updated locally |

> **Note on shapefiles:** The elevation shapefiles were generated by manually sampling the MOLA DEM in QGIS and are not included due to file size. Update the file paths in the first cell of each notebook to point to your local copies.
